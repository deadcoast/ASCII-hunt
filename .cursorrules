# CURSORRULES

## Workflow & Instructions

Context First: Mandatory `PR` workflow when generating or correcting code.
Do not assume or guess in code integrations. you must integrate the planning in the [docs](./docs) directory.
Incremental Implementation: Generate code in manageable steps, maintaining consistency with existing codebase. 4. Knowledge Management: Document reusable components, fixes, and implementation decisions in the [System_Integration.md](./changelog/system_integration.md) file.

5. Prime Rules (`PR`):

   1. Review `Scratchpad` for the `Tasklist` and plan implementation steps
   2. Based on the request, search for relevant build plans in the [System_Integration.md](./changelog/system_integration.md) directory and adjust plan accordingly
   3. Take action to complete the next Task
   4. Identify implementation gaps and plan necessary steps
   5. Document code integration in `changelog/System_Integration.md` to maintain a record of the code integrations for consistency.
   6. Update the `Scratchpad`, with progress markers, to reflect the current state of the implementation.

6. `Scratchpad` Usage: Maintain a task list in this file following this format:

   ```
   ## Scratchpad

   [X] Task 1
   [ ] Task 2
   ```

   Update progress markers as subtasks are completed. Use the Scratchpad to maintain implementation context and track progress.
