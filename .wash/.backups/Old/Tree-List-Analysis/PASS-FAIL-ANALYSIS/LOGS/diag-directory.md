# Complete Technical Architecture Diagnostic

1. Run a complete diagnostics on my codebase, organize and categorize it with the purpose of cross referencing it with the complete technical architecture overview.

2. You must take notes on how the codebase is implemented, in what methods, errors, what modulesa re not yet integrated into the source code workflow. This comprehensive and complete diagnostic you create will be a guide to cross reference againt all of the documentation below.

3. This must be a best in practise, professional review of the current source code in @src . We need to start identifying straggling code and prepare to build it into the system in all aspects.
