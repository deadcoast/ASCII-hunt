# CURSORRULES

## Workflow & Instructions

Context First: Mandatory `PR` workflow when generating or correcting code.
Incremental Implementation: Generate code in manageable steps, maintaining consistency with existing codebase. 4. Knowledge Management: Document reusable components, fixes, and implementation decisions in the [System_Integration.md](./changelog/system_integration.md) file.

Prime Rules (`PR`):

1. Review `Scratchpad` for the `Tasklist` and plan implementation steps
2. Based on the request, search for relevant build plans in the [docs](/docs/build-docs/) directory and adjust plan accordingly
3. Take action to complete the next Task
4. Identify implementation gaps and plan necessary steps
5. Document code integration in [System-Integration.md](/docs/build-docs/System_Integration.md) to maintain a record of the code integrations for consistency.
6. Update the `Scratchpad`, with progress markers, to reflect the current state of the implementation.

7. `Scratchpad` Usage: Maintain a task list in this file following this format:

```md
## Scratchpad

[X] Task 1
[ ] Task 2
```

Update progress markers as subtasks are completed. Use the Scratchpad to maintain implementation context and track progress.
