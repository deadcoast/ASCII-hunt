# ASCII Utils

- Implements a utility class `ASCIIUtils` with static methods for ASCII art processing
- Core functionality categories:
  - File operations: loading and saving ASCII grids from/to files
  - Conversion: transforming between string and numpy array representations
  - Information retrieval: dimensions, character counts, unique characters, positions
  - Grid manipulation: character replacement, region extraction, grid insertion, border operations
- Implementation details:
  - Uses numpy arrays for efficient grid representation and operations
  - Follows functional programming style with immutable operations (returns new grids)
  - Comprehensive docstrings with parameter and return value descriptions
  - Strong type hinting throughout the codebase
- Key methods:
  - `load_grid`/`save_grid`: File I/O operations with line normalization
  - `grid_to_string`/`string_to_grid`: Bidirectional conversions
  - `extract_region`/`insert_grid`: Grid composition operations
  - `create_border`/`remove_border`: Visual formatting operations
  - `center_text`: Layout utility for text centering
- Dependencies:
  - numpy for array operations
  - pathlib for file path handling
- Architectural role:
  - Foundation utility class for higher-level ASCII processing algorithms
  - Abstraction layer for grid operations used by pattern matching and layout components
