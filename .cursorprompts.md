# CURSOR prompts

## FIRST Prompt

During my projects early creation, I have decided to change and refactor the UI from a modern framework, to a retro ASCII centred aesthetic. Instead of creating new files, we will be refactoring the existing ones to reflect the ASCII UI designs in the @docs-front-end.md and @docs-ASCII-modules.md files.

Begin by reviewing the @.cursorrules.md , this is your workflow, you must always adhere to it. Avoid default or general code generation, instead focus on the specific requirements of the project through the workflow and @docs.

## UNUSED variables

```
Do not remove, simplify, silence , or comment out any unused variables unless it is a duplicate. This chat is an acive production development enviornment. Current Tasks: 1.Correcting Linting Errors 2. Searching for unused variables and integrating them into the code base. 3. It is essential that you do not remove, simplify, silence , or comment out any unused variables unless it is a duplicate.
```

## LOCAL IMPORTS

```
ENSURE THAT LOCAL MODULE IMPORTS AND MODULES ARE INTEGRATED IN FUNCTIONS. Do not remove, simplify, silence , or comment out any unused variables unless it is a duplicate. Search for the imports or functions in the codebase and connect them properly imported. This chat is an acive production development enviornment. Current Tasks: 1.Correcting Linting Errors 2. Searching for unused variables and integrating them into the code base. 3. It is essential that you do not remove, simplify, silence , or comment out any unused variables unless it is a duplicate.

# DIAGNOSIS TREE TASKLIST

**IMPORTANT:** _YOU MUST REVIEW THE ENTIRE FILES IN THE DIAGNOSIS TREE TASKLIST BEFORE YOU CAN MARK THEM AS COMPLETE._

{STEP-1}: REVIEW ONE ENTIRE FILE AT A TIME

{STEP-2}: WHEN YOU COMPLETELY FINISH REVIEWING ONE FILE: Immediately write your comprehensive diagnosis and analysis findings in the documentation section below the Directory Tree Tasklist. When documentation is complete, mark the file as complete on the Diagnosis Tree Tasklist.

{"STEP-3":"instructions":"REAPEAT "{STEP-1,STEP-2}" FOR EACH FILE IN THE DIAGNOSIS TREE TASKLIST" When you have completed this section of the Diagnostic Tree Tasklist, Mark the entire task as complete on the Title Header at the top of the page.}

CURRENT DIAGNOSIS TREE TASKLIST:
@01-adapters-and-algorithms.md

---

1. Provide a comprehensive diagnosis and analysisof each file one by on, ensuring you are covering all aspects.

- provide verbose, complete, front to back code analysis and review.
- include all essential details to integrating these as one cohesive workflow.
