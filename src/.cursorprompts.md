# CURSOR prompts

## FIRST Prompt

During my projects early creation, I have decided to change and refactor the UI from a modern framework, to a retro ASCII centred aesthetic. Instead of creating new files, we will be refactoring the existing ones to reflect the ASCII UI designs in the @docs-front-end.md and @docs-ASCII-modules.md files.

Begin by reviewing the @.cursorrules.md , this is your workflow, you must always adhere to it. Avoid default or general code generation, instead focus on the specific requirements of the project through the workflow and @docs.
