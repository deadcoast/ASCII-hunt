## 2.1 Flood Fill Algorithm

### Mathematical Formulation

The Flood Fill algorithm operates on a discrete 2D grid $G$ of dimensions $m \times n$ where each cell contains a character.

Input: A grid $G$, a starting point $(x_0, y_0)$, and a set of boundary characters $B$.

Definition: Let $V(x,y)$ be the visitation state of cell $(x,y)$, where: $V(x,y) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if cell has been visited} \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

Algorithm:

1. Initialize queue $Q = {(x_0, y_0)}$, visited set $V$ with $V(x_0, y_0) = 1$
2. Initialize interior region $I = {(x_0, y_0)}$ and boundary region $B = \emptyset$
3. While $Q$ is not empty: a. Dequeue $(x, y)$ from $Q$ b. For each adjacent cell $(x', y')$ where $(x', y') \in {(x+1,y), (x-1,y), (x,y+1), (x,y-1)}$: i. If $G(x', y') \in B$: - Add to boundary: $B = B \cup {(x', y')}$ ii. Else if $V(x', y') = 0$: - Mark as visited: $V(x', y') = 1$ - Add to interior: $I = I \cup {(x', y')}$ - Enqueue: $Q = Q \cup {(x', y')}$

The component boundary is formally defined as: $\mathcal{B} = {(x,y) \in G | G(x,y) \in B \text{ and } \exists (x',y') \in I \text{ such that } |x-x'| + |y-y'| = 1}$

For boundary analysis, we calculate the bounding box as: $x_{min} = \min{x | (x,y) \in \mathcal{B}}$ $x_{max} = \max{x | (x,y) \in \mathcal{B}}$ $y_{min} = \min{y | (x,y) \in \mathcal{B}}$ $y_{max} = \max{y | (x,y) \in \mathcal{B}}$

The component dimensions are then: $width = x_{max} - x_{min} + 1$ $height = y_{max} - y_{min} + 1$

### NumPy Implementation

```python
def flood_fill_component(grid, start_x, start_y, boundary_chars):
    """
    Implements the mathematical flood fill algorithm using NumPy operations.
    """
    height, width = grid.shape
    visited = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=bool)

    # Initialize for vectorized operations
    interior = set([(start_x, start_y)])
    boundary = set()
    queue = [(start_x, start_y)]
    visited[start_y, start_x] = True

    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.pop(0)

        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy

            if 0 <= nx < width and 0 <= ny < height:
                if grid[ny, nx] in boundary_chars:
                    boundary.add((nx, ny))
                elif not visited[ny, nx]:
                    visited[ny, nx] = True
                    interior.add((nx, ny))
                    queue.append((nx, ny))

    # Calculate component properties using NumPy operations
    if boundary:
        boundary_array = np.array(list(boundary))
        min_x, min_y = boundary_array.min(axis=0)
        max_x, max_y = boundary_array.max(axis=0)

        return {
            'interior': interior,
            'boundary': boundary,
            'bounding_box': (min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y),
            'width': max_x - min_x + 1,
            'height': max_y - min_y + 1
        }

    return None
```

## 2.2 Connected Component Analysis

### Mathematical Formulation

The Connected Component Analysis operates on labeled regions identified by the Flood Fill algorithm.

Let ${C_1, C_2, ..., C_n}$ be the set of components identified, where each $C_i$ contains:

- Interior points $I_i$
- Boundary points $B_i$
- Bounding box $(x_{min}^i, y_{min}^i, x_{max}^i, y_{max}^i)$

For each component $C_i$, we extract a feature vector $F_i$ where:

$F_i = [f_1^i, f_2^i, ..., f_k^i]$

Feature extraction includes:

1. Aspect Ratio: $f_{aspect}^i = \frac{width_i}{height_i}$
2. Border Density: $f_{border}^i = \frac{|B_i|}{2 \times (width_i + height_i)}$
3. Content Density: $f_{content}^i = \frac{|I_i|}{width_i \times height_i}$
4. Character Distribution: For each character type $c$, the frequency is: $f_c^i = \frac{|{(x,y) \in I_i | G(x,y) = c}|}{|I_i|}$
5. Corner Detection: Corner score based on the presence of corner characters: $f_{corner}^i = \frac{|{(x,y) \in B_i | G(x,y) \in \text{corner_chars}}|}{4}$

Components are grouped based on spatial proximity and feature similarity:

Two components $C_i$ and $C_j$ are merged if: $d(F_i, F_j) < \tau_f$ and $dist(C_i, C_j) < \tau_d$

Where distance functions are defined as:

$d(F_i, F_j) = \sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{n} w_k(f_k^i - f_k^j)^2}$

And spatial distance between components:

$dist(C_i, C_j) = \min_{(x,y) \in B_i, (x',y') \in B_j} \sqrt{(x-x')^2 + (y-y')^2}$

## 2.3 Hierarchical Clustering

### Mathematical Formulation

Hierarchical clustering establishes the containment relationships between UI components.

Let $C = {C_1, C_2, ..., C_n}$ be the set of components with bounding boxes $B_i = (x_{min}^i, y_{min}^i, x_{max}^i, y_{max}^i)$.

We define a containment matrix $M$ where:

$M_{ij} = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } B_i \text{ contains } B_j \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$

A bounding box $B_i$ contains $B_j$ if: $x_{min}^i < x_{min}^j \text{ and } y_{min}^i < y_{min}^j \text{ and } x_{max}^i > x_{max}^j \text{ and } y_{max}^i > y_{max}^j$

We define a containment score based on the area ratio:

$containment_score(C_i, C_j) = \frac{area(B_j)}{area(B_i)} = \frac{(x_{max}^j - x_{min}^j) \times (y_{max}^j - y_{min}^j)}{(x_{max}^i - x_{min}^i) \times (y_{max}^i - y_{min}^i)}$

For hierarchical clustering, we use a distance function that combines spatial and functional distances:

$D(C_i, C_j) = w_s \times d_s(C_i, C_j) + w_f \times d_f(C_i, C_j)$

Where:

- $d_s$ is the spatial distance based on containment and alignment
- $d_f$ is the functional distance based on component types and relationships
- $w_s$ and $w_f$ are weighting factors

The agglomerative clustering process:

1. Start with each component as its own cluster
2. Iteratively merge the two closest clusters
3. Update distances between the new cluster and all other clusters
4. Stop when all components are in a single cluster or a threshold is reached

The dendrogram is then cut at an appropriate level to create a logical UI hierarchy.

## 2.4 Decision Trees

### Mathematical Formulation

Our Decision Tree classifier maps component features to UI element types.

For a component $C$ with feature vector $F = [f_1, f_2, ..., f_k]$, the classification task is to find a function $h$ such that: $h(F) = y$, where $y$ is the UI element type.

The decision tree is constructed using the information gain criterion:

1. For a set of examples $S$, the entropy is: $H(S) = -\sum_{y \in Y} p(y) \log_2 p(y)$ where $p(y)$ is the proportion of examples in $S$ with classification $y$.
2. The information gain from splitting on feature $f_j$ is: $IG(S, f_j) = H(S) - \sum_{v \in Values(f_j)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v)$ where $S_v$ is the subset of examples where feature $f_j$ has value $v$.
3. At each node, we select the feature with maximum information gain: $f^* = \arg\max_{f_j} IG(S, f_j)$

For specialized UI features, we define:

1. Border Type Feature: $f_{border_type}(C) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if single-line border} \ 2 & \text{if double-line border} \ 3 & \text{if heavy-line border} \ 4 & \text{if rounded border} \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$
2. Button Detection Feature: $f_{button}(C) = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if matches button pattern} \ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$ where button pattern is defined by:

   - Text surrounded by brackets: [Text]
   - Text surrounded by border characters
   - Small width-to-height ratio component

3. Content Type Feature: Based on character distribution: $f_{content_type}(C) = \arg\max_{t \in Types} p(t|C_{chars})$ where $p(t|C_{chars})$ is calculated using Bayes' theorem.

## 2.5 Dynamic Programming

### Mathematical Formulation

For efficient pattern matching in ASCII UI recognition, we implement dynamic programming algorithms:

#### 1. Sequence Alignment using Needleman-Wunsch

For comparing UI patterns with templates, we use global sequence alignment:

Given two sequences $A = a_1a_2...a_n$ and $B = b_1b_2...b_m$, we build a matrix $F$ where:

$F(i,j) = \text{optimal alignment score of prefixes } A[1..i] \text{ and } B[1..j]$

The recurrence relation is:

$F(i,j) = \max \begin{cases} F(i-1,j-1) + s(a_i, b_j) \ F(i-1,j) + g \ F(i,j-1) + g \end{cases}$

Where:

- $s(a,b)$ is the similarity score between characters $a$ and $b$
- $g$ is the gap penalty

The optimal alignment score is $F(n,m)$, and the alignment can be reconstructed by backtracking.

#### 2. Edit Distance using Levenshtein Distance

For fuzzy matching of UI patterns:

Given two strings $A$ and $B$, the edit distance $D(A,B)$ is the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, substitutions) to transform $A$ into $B$.

The recurrence relation is:

$D(i,j) = \min \begin{cases} D(i-1,j) + 1 \ D(i,j-1) + 1 \ D(i-1,j-1) + [a_i \neq b_j] \end{cases}$

Where $[a_i \neq b_j]$ is 1 if $a_i \neq b_j$ and 0 otherwise.

#### 3. Longest Common Subsequence

For identifying shared patterns:

Given two strings $A$ and $B$, find the longest subsequence present in both.

The recurrence relation is:

$LCS(i,j) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } i = 0 \text{ or } j = 0 \ LCS(i-1,j-1) + 1 & \text{if } a_i = b_j \ \max(LCS(i-1,j), LCS(i,j-1)) & \text{if } a_i \neq b_j \end{cases}$
