## 7.1 Integration of HUNT DSL with ASCII UI Translation Framework

The HUNT DSL offers a sophisticated syntax for defining, processing, and translating ASCII UI elements into functional code. This section outlines how HUNT will be integrated with our ASCII UI Translation Framework to create a powerful, declarative pattern recognition system that leverages the strengths of both technologies.

### Core Integration Architecture

HUNT's Cabin Brackets Hierarchical System (CBHS) provides an ideal structure for defining the pattern recognition rules needed to identify UI components in ASCII grids. The integration will follow these architectural principles:

1. **Layered Implementation**: The HUNT interpreter will sit as a configurable layer between the raw ASCII input and the algorithmic processing pipeline, allowing users to define custom pattern recognition rules.
2. **Bidirectional Translation**: The system will translate between HUNT DSL expressions and the internal component model, enabling both definition of patterns and generation of code from recognized components.
3. **Extensible Rule System**: The hierarchical nature of HUNT's bracket system maps naturally to the hierarchical structure of UI components, allowing for precise definition of component patterns.
4. **Performance Optimization**: The DSL interpreter will be optimized to efficiently parse and apply pattern recognition rules, with minimal overhead compared to hardcoded recognition algorithms.

### HUNT Pattern Library

A comprehensive library of pre-defined patterns for recognizing common UI elements will be developed:

#### 1. Box and Container Patterns

```hunt
< hunt Track:
    [INIT GATHER =
        {param tag:window =
            (val
             top_left:(┌),
             top_right:(┐),
             bottom_left:(└),
             bottom_right:(┘),
             horizontal:(─),
             vertical:(│)
            )
        }
        {param pluck:title =
            (val "^(.+)$")  # First line of content
        }
    ]
><EXEC>

< hunt Track:
    [INIT GATHER =
        {param tag:panel =
            (val
             top_left:(╔),
             top_right:(╗),
             bottom_left:(╚),
             bottom_right:(╝),
             horizontal:(═),
             vertical:(║)
            )
        }
    ]
><EXEC>

< hunt Track:
    [INIT GATHER =
        {param tag:group_box =
            (val
             top_left:(┏),
             top_right:(┓),
             bottom_left:(┗),
             bottom_right:(┛),
             horizontal:(━),
             vertical:(┃)
            )
        }
        {param pluck:group_title =
            (val "^(.+)$")  # First line of content
        }
    ]
><EXEC>
```

#### 2. Control Patterns

            (val "●|\\(•\\)", "○|\\( \\)")
        }
        {param pluck:radio_label =
            (val "(?:●|○|\\(•\\)|\\( \\))\\s*(.+)")  # Text after radio button
        }

## 7.2 Pattern Recognition DSL Specification

The pattern recognition DSL will be designed to allow declarative definition of ASCII UI patterns:

### Syntax and Semantics

1. **Top-Level Commands**:

   - `hunt`: Define a pattern or module
   - `Track`: Define a tracking pattern for UI elements
   - `GATHER`/`GET`: Extract characters and coordinates
   - `HARVEST`/`HARV`: Collect data from multiple regions
   - `RACK`: Preview pattern visualization
   - `COOK`: Generate code from recognized patterns

2. **Parameter Expressions**:

   - `tag`: Define pattern tags for classification
   - `pluck`: Extract specific content based on patterns
   - `trap`: Define constraints or validation rules
   - `skin`: Extract from partial matches
   - `log`: Control debugging and logging output

3. **Execution Controls**:
   - `EXEC`: Execute pattern processing
   - `req`: Make pattern requirements strict
   - `prohib`: Specify prohibited patterns
   - `config`: Configure processing options

### Pattern Definition Example

```hunt
< hunt Button:
    [INIT GATHER =
        {param tag:button =
            (val
             box_chars:(┌┐└┘│─),  # Optional box characters
             bracket_chars:("[", "]")  # Button can be in [] brackets
            )
        }
        {param pluck:button_text =
            (val
             bracket_pattern:"\\[(.+?)\\]",  # Extract text between []
             box_pattern:"(?<=\\n\\s*)(.+?)(?=\\s*\\n)"  # Extract text in box
            )
        }
        {param trap =
            (val "text must not be empty")  # Validation rule
        }
    ]
><EXEC>
```

### Pattern Matching Process

The pattern matching process will follow these steps:

1. **Parse HUNT Patterns**: Convert HUNT DSL code into an AST
2. **Register Patterns**: Store patterns in the pattern registry
3. **Apply Patterns**: Apply patterns to detected components from earlier pipeline stages
4. **Extract Properties**: Extract component properties based on pattern matches
5. **Determine Types**: Classify components based on best pattern matches
6. **Detect Relationships**: Apply relationship patterns to determine component hierarchies
7. **Validate Results**: Apply validation rules to ensure pattern integrity

### Integration with Component Model

The DSL will integrate with the component model through these mechanisms:

1. **Type Classification**: Determine the UI element type based on pattern matches
2. **Property Extraction**: Extract properties like labels, values, and states
3. **Relationship Detection**: Establish parent-child and logical relationships
4. **Validation Rules**: Ensure component integrity and completeness

### Extensibility Mechanisms

The DSL will support extensibility through:

1. **Custom Pattern Libraries**: Load user-defined pattern collections
2. **Pattern Inheritance**: Extend existing patterns with additional rules
3. **Plugin Architecture**: Register custom pattern matchers and extractors

This comprehensive implementation plan establishes the foundation for a flexible, extensible pattern recognition system that leverages the structured syntax and semantics of HUNT to streamline the process of translating ASCII UI designs into functional code.

By adopting HUNT's Cabin Brackets Hierarchical System, we create a natural mapping between the hierarchical structure of UI components and the pattern definitions used to recognize them. The implementation strategy outlined here ensures that the system is both powerful for advanced users who want fine-grained control over pattern matching and accessible for those who simply want to use pre-defined patterns.

The robust architecture includes:

1. A complete parser and interpreter for HUNT syntax
2. A flexible pattern matching system for UI component recognition
3. A pattern registry for managing and retrieving pattern definitions
4. Integration with the core processing pipeline
