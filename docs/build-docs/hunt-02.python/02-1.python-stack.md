## Library Integration Strategy

To ensure these libraries work together effectively:

1. Data Flow Pipeline: Define clear interfaces between processing stages
2. Common Data Structures: Establish shared representations accessible to all libraries
3. Processing Optimization: Minimize data conversions between libraries
4. Extension Points: Create plugin architecture for additional libraries and algorithms

This comprehensive integration of NumPy, OpenCV, NetworkX, and PyQt5/PySide will provide a solid foundation for the ASCII UI translation framework.

## 2. Python Handler Mapping

Each DSL command maps to a Python function or decorator-style handler. These handlers can live in a central dispatcher inside your DSL engine.

### DSL Command â†’ Python Function Mapping

```python
# dsl_handlers.py

@dsl_command("hunt")
def handle_hunt(params):
    # Run grid scanner
    return dsl_grid(**params)

@dsl_command("skin")
def handle_skin(params):
    return extract_coordinates(**params)

@dsl_command("gather")
def handle_gather(params):
    return organize_tags(**params)

@dsl_command("harvest")
def handle_harvest(params):
    return bulk_merge(**params)

@dsl_command("pluck")
def handle_pluck(params):
    return extract_target(**params)

@dsl_command("trap")
def handle_trap(params):
    return assert_constraints(**params)

@dsl_command("scent")
def handle_scent(params):
    return warn_soft(**params)

@dsl_command("snare")
def handle_snare(params):
    raise DSLFatalError(params["message"])

@dsl_command("rack")
def handle_rack(params):
    return visualize_output(**params)

@dsl_command("track")
def handle_track(params):
    return setup_logging(**params)

@dsl_command("boil")
def handle_boil(params):
    return simplify_output(**params)

@dsl_command("cook")
def handle_cook(params):
    return generate_code(**params)
```

You can then wire these into a simple command dispatcher:

```python
COMMAND_REGISTRY = {}

def dsl_command(name):
    def decorator(fn):
        COMMAND_REGISTRY[name] = fn
        return fn
    return decorator

def execute_dsl_command(command, params):
    handler = COMMAND_REGISTRY.get(command)
    if not handler:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown command: {command}")
    return handler(params)
```
