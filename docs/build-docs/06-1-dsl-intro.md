# 6.1 DSL Introduction - `hunt` Syntax

## Introduction

### Tab Spaced & Bracket Based Hierarchal

hunt enforces aVertical Hierarchal and TAB spaced organized syntax. It focuses on modular codebases with its Cabin Brackets System(CBHS), creating modular code blocks for all functions. It further enforces this structure by requiring the first two tiers of the CBHS to be aligned vertically. You will find that the CBHS creates an enhanced, rigid, reinforced and organized structure when building out your code blocks without the hassle of semi-colons and commas beside brackets.

### Error Friendly

Continuous code system, it will continue its code fnction even through error. The Multiple levels of the CBHS system provides several layers of security and reinforcement to error interruptions. Additionally, the enhancements and modifications to the Executate statement allow the user to pinpoint what they want to use, where, or just leave it untill the end and put it all together. Another feature of the CBHS is it allows the code to compile much easier. All code blocks are encased for an easy setup and checkout for most compilers.

### Introduction Conclusion

In short, hunt Syntax will try its best to circumvent errors in the code and partially run what it can, when it can without the hassle of type checks and tedious imports. For further customizations, Paramaters functions like 'req' will create a strict and rigid enviornment when runnig the code, forcing hunt to shutdown without the attached req function.

## 6.1.2 How it Works

hunt Syntax - A customizable, self contained and simple bracket based syntax.

[CBHS](Cabin Bracket Hierarchal System) the organizational structure of the hunt syntax.

1. Cabin Bracket Hierarchal System: the Tab spaced Bracket System in the hunt syntax.

   - `< >, [ ], { }, ( )`
   - hunt [CBHS] enforses a Two Tier vertical heirarchy in its 4 tier Bracket system.
   - What this means is, the first two brackets require a reachable vertical connection through the code blocks structure.

2. `AlphaBracket < >` - First Tier [CBHS]

   - Namespace: `hunt, EXEC`
   - Main control point of each and every code block.
   - This tier helps structure and modularize the code, ensuring the entire code file is structured and modularized.
   - _The Vertical heirarchy is enforcedin this tier._

3. `INITIALIZER [ ]` - The Second Tier [CBHS]

   - Namespace: `INIT`
   - Initializers control the validation and requirements of the code block.
   - The initializers control the validation and requirements of the code block.
   - They from the main hunt AlphaBracket.
   - _The Vertical heirarchy is enforced in this tier._

4. `PARAMETERS { }` - The third Tier [CBHS]

   - Namespace: `PARAM`
   - The Paramaters inherit from the Initializers, this tier handles definining the functions the Variables will operate on.
   - _The Vertical heirarchy is NOT enforcedin this tier._

5. `VALUES ( )` - The fourth Tier [CBHS]

   - Namespace: `VAL`
   - The Variables inherit from the Paramater's, this tier handles the specifics and definitions.
   - _The Vertical heirarchy is NOT enforced in this tier._

6. `EXECUTOR < > ` - The Fifth Tier [CBHS]
   - Namespace: `EXEC`
   - The fifth tier is the execution code block.
   - This tier controls customizations and batch handing of your projects code, it helps customize exactly how and what is executed.

The HUNT DSL offers a sophisticated syntax for defining, processing, and translating ASCII UI elements into functional code. This section outlines how HUNT will be integrated with our ASCII UI Translation Framework to create a powerful, declarative pattern recognition system that leverages the strengths of both technologies.

### Core Integration Architecture

HUNT's Cabin Brackets Hierarchical System (CBHS) provides an ideal structure for defining the pattern recognition rules needed to identify UI components in ASCII grids. The integration will follow these architectural principles:

1. Layered Implementation: The HUNT interpreter will sit as a configurable layer between the raw ASCII input and the algorithmic processing pipeline, allowing users to define custom pattern recognition rules.
2. Bidirectional Translation: The system will translate between HUNT DSL expressions and the internal component model, enabling both definition of patterns and generation of code from recognized components.
3. Extensible Rule System: The hierarchical nature of HUNT's bracket system maps naturally to the hierarchical structure of UI components, allowing for precise definition of component patterns.
4. Performance Optimization: The DSL interpreter will be optimized to efficiently parse and apply pattern recognition rules, with minimal overhead compared to hardcoded recognition algorithms.

### Pattern Matching Process

The pattern matching process will follow these steps:

1. Parse HUNT Patterns: Convert HUNT DSL code into an AST
2. Register Patterns: Store patterns in the pattern registry
3. Apply Patterns: Apply patterns to detected components from earlier pipeline stages
4. Extract Properties: Extract component properties based on pattern matches
5. Determine Types: Classify components based on best pattern matches
6. Detect Relationships: Apply relationship patterns to determine component hierarchies
7. Validate Results: Apply validation rules to ensure pattern integrity

### Integration with Component Model

The DSL will integrate with the component model through these mechanisms:

1. Type Classification: Determine the UI element type based on pattern matches
2. Property Extraction: Extract properties like labels, values, and states
3. Relationship Detection: Establish parent-child and logical relationships
4. Validation Rules: Ensure component integrity and completeness

### Extensibility Mechanisms

The DSL will support extensibility through:

1. Custom Pattern Libraries: Load user-defined pattern collections
2. Pattern Inheritance: Extend existing patterns with additional rules
3. Plugin Architecture: Register custom pattern matchers and extractors
4. Configuration System: Configure pattern matching behavior

## 6.1.3 Implementation Roadmap

## 6.1.5 Conclusion

The integration of the HUNT DSL with the ASCII UI Translation Framework provides a powerful, declarative mechanism for defining and recognizing UI patterns in ASCII grids. This comprehensive implementation plan establishes the foundation for a flexible, extensible pattern recognition system that leverages the structured syntax and semantics of HUNT to streamline the process of translating ASCII UI designs into functional code.
By adopting HUNT's Cabin Brackets Hierarchical System, we create a natural mapping between the hierarchical structure of UI components and the pattern definitions used to recognize them. The implementation strategy outlined here ensures that the system is both powerful for advanced users who want fine-grained control over pattern matching and accessible for those who simply want to use pre-defined patterns.
The robust architecture includes:

1. A complete parser and interpreter for HUNT syntax
2. A flexible pattern matching system for UI component recognition
3. A pattern registry for managing and retrieving pattern definitions
4. Integration with the core processing pipeline
5. Visualization and debugging tools for pattern development
6. Advanced features like pattern learning and optimization

This integration leverages the strengths of both the HUNT DSL and the ASCII UI Translation Framework to create a system that is greater than the sum of its parts, providing a comprehensive solution for the challenge of translating ASCII UI designs into functional code.
